        # Banon's Health command casts Cure 2 on the party with a unique animation.
        # Because the animation is unique, it has the step-forward component built into it.  
        # And because Cure 2 can be reflected, if the command hits a mirrored target it will bounce and make Banon step forward again.

        # Used over and over, Banon can be made to walk completely off-screen.

        # Fix:
        # We tell the HEALTH animation to ignore block graphics, which prevents the reflect animation from playing.  
        # When encountering a reflection, the regular green Cure 2 animation will follow on the reflect recipient.
