# List of addresses within the Battle Animation Scripts for the following commands which cause screen flashes:
#  B0 - Set background palette color addition (absolute)
#  B5 - Add color to background palette (relative)
#  AF - Set background palette color subtraction (absolute)
#  B6 - Subtract color from background palette (relative)
# By changing address + 1 to E0 (for absolute) or F0 (for relative), it causes no change to the background color (that is, no flash)
